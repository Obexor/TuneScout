# üéµ Streamlit Music Upload, Streaming, and Equalizer App

A simple yet powerful web application built with **Streamlit** that allows users to upload music, store its metadata and audio fingerprints in **Amazon DynamoDB**, and stream songs securely using pre-signed URLs from **Amazon S3**. Additionally, it includes an equalizer feature for enhancing the audio playback experience.

This project demonstrates the integration of cloud services with a user-friendly interface for music upload, metadata management, deduplication using fingerprints, secure streaming, and audio equalization.

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- **AWS Account** with the IAM user having access to:
  - S3 Bucket for storing songs (`s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject` permissions).
  - DynamoDB Table for storing songs metadata (`dynamodb:PutItem`, `dynamodb:Scan` permissions).

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/streamlit-music-app.git
   cd streamlit-music-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure AWS Credentials**:
   Provide your AWS credentials (`aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key`) either using:
   - **Environment variables**:
     ```bash
     export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='your-access-key'
     export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='your-secret-key'
     export AWS_REGION='your-region'
     export AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME='your-bucket-name'
     export AWS_TABLE_NAME_SONGDATA='your-dynamodb-song-data-table-name'
     export AWS_TABLE_NAME_HASHES='your-dynamodb-hashes-table-name'
     export AWS_USER_TABLE_NAME='your-dynamodb-user-table-name'
     ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file with the following structure:
   ```
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='your-access-key'
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='your-secret-key'
    AWS_REGION='your-region'
    AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME='your-bucket-name'
    AWS_TABLE_NAME_SONGDATA='your-dynamodb-song-data-table-name'
    AWS_TABLE_NAME_HASHES='your-dynamodb-hashes-table-name'
    AWS_USER_TABLE_NAME='your-dynamodb-user-table-name'
   ```

5. **Run the Application**:
   Start the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

6. Open your browser at **http://localhost:8501** to view the app.

## üõ°Ô∏è AWS Setup

### 1. **Create an S3 Bucket**
   - Go to the AWS Management Console, open **S3**, and create a bucket.
   - Note the bucket name as it will be required in your app environment.

### 2. **Set Up a DynamoDB Table**
   - Open the DynamoDB service in AWS Console and create a new table.
   - Define a primary key as `song_id` (Number) or any field you'd like to use.
   - Define a new table with a primary key as `hash` (String) for storing audio fingerprints.
   - Define a new table with a primary key as `username` (String) for storing user credentials.

### 3. **IAM User Permissions**
   Ensure your IAM user/role has permissions for:
   - `s3:PutObject`
   - `s3:GetObject`
   - `dynamodb:PutItem`
   - `dynamodb:Scan`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Structure

### Overall Workflow:
1. **Upload**: The user uploads an audio file or records using a microphone.
2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Convert files to WAV format.
   - Generate audio fingerprints for comparison.
3. **Database Operations**:
   - Store metadata in DynamoDB.
   - Save fingerprints separately in a DynamoDB `Hashes` table.
   - Store raw audio files in an S3 bucket.
4. **Recognition**:
   - Compare uploaded or recorded audio against the database.
   - Match using fingerprint hashes stored in DynamoDB.
5. **Streaming**:
   - Securely stream audio files stored in S3 to the user.

## üîë Key Functionalities

### 1. **Uploading Songs**
   - Upload a song (MP3/WAV).
   - Input metadata like title, artist, and album.
   - Automatically generates fingerprints to detect duplicates.

### 2. **Database Operations**
   - Add new songs to DynamoDB with a unique identifier (`song_id`).
   - Ensure no duplicate uploads by checking existing fingerprints.

### 3. **Secure Streaming**
   - List uploaded songs and their metadata from DynamoDB.
   - Use pre-signed URLs to securely stream files directly from S3 in the browser.

### 4. **Audio Equalizer**
   - Adjust audio frequencies (bass, mid, treble) to enhance playback.
   - Save custom equalizer settings for future use.

## ‚ùì FAQs

### 1. **How are duplicates identified?**
   Duplicates are identified by generating **audio fingerprints** for each song and comparing them to records in DynamoDB. If a match exists, the song is not uploaded again.

### 2. **What is a pre-signed URL?**
   Pre-signed URLs allow temporary, secure access to S3 files without exposing your bucket publicly. The app uses boto3 to generate these URLs.

### 3. **What happens if metadata is missing?**
   The app uses default values (e.g., "Unknown Title", "Unknown Artist") if metadata is not provided.

### 4. **How does the equalizer work?**
   The equalizer allows users to adjust audio frequencies to enhance playback. Users can save their custom settings and apply them to any song.
